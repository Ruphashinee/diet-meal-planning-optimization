# Diet Meal Planning Optimization

This project applies Evolutionary Programming (EP) to solve a diet meal planning
optimization problem under nutritional and budget constraints.

## Algorithm
- Evolutionary Programming (mutation-based optimization)
- Single-objective and extended multi-objective formulation

## Streamlit App
The Streamlit dashboard allows users to:
- Set calorie, protein, and budget constraints
- Visualize convergence of the algorithm
- View optimized meal plan solutions

## Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
